This was made by [Nick Catalano](http://twitter.com/nickcatal) because he was tired of trying to find a list of petition responses on the White House [petition website](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov).

This is in no way endorsed by any organization or government agency. The data on the White House website is used under the assumption that it is public domain.
